This is going to be a 2d simplified minecraft. You have your character that is a block that starts as green. The character will have a health bar. The character starts in a 2d canvas rectangle where there are blocks of ore randomly spawned. There are a few different ores: iron, gold, diamond and emerald. The first level will only have one or two blocks spawn with only the lowest type of ore, iron. A level ends once you have mined all the ores. You have to mine the ore by just running into it. When you spawn in a level, there will be enemies that spawn and attack you. To kill enemies the player uses the mouse/trackpad and shoots arrows at the enemies. The player may not shoot and mine at the same time. The enemies will get harder as you advance levels. The enemies will be be blocks of different mob faces, like skeletons and zombies. Skeletons will shoot and zombies will chase the character. In between levels it shows all your resources: iron, gold, diamond and emerald. With these you can choose to upgrade your health (armour), mining speed (pick), and attack (bow). When you finish a level, by mining all ores, or due you will be able to upgrade. You move on levels when you win. As you advance level there are more and harder enemies, but also more ores will appear and better ores will appear. The difficulty should increase about 5% each level and the ores should get better at a rate of 3% therefore making the game progessively harder. There is a 2 player version where one person is the miner and walks around mining using WASD keyboard to move while the other player uses the arrow keys to move and shoot with the mouse/trackpad. The player that attacks the mobs must protect the other player while he mines for ores.

I put some graphics into a folder called blocks. They are labeled.
